# Privacy Policy

The privacy policy is simple: no personal data shared with us will be given to any third party, under any circumstances. Telemetry is collected on our servers for internal review only to optimize application performance and troubleshoot errors.

The app engages in no ad targeting or other activities that may compromise your privacy, and we do not affiliate ourselves with any third parties that do so.
